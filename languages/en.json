    "fascination": "I have always been fascinated by wide open spaces and the power of nature, and through my art practice I seek to convey my admiration for this grandiose spectacle, be it slow or dazzling, intimidating or marvellous, that our planet offers us every day. I sometimes tackle head-on ecological themes such as the protection or destruction of nature. I often celebrate the seasons, the pillars that are the sun, water and earth. I always emphasise the infinite resilience of the plant and animal kingdoms which can and will reclaim every last trace of plastic and concrete. Between symbolism, dreamlike imagery and magical realism emerges the figure of the raccoon, an intelligent, bold and highly invasive creature thanks to its adaptability. Without anthropomorphism, the raccoon is both a mirror of humanity in its spread and its destructive, predator-free conquering nature, and a garbage remover who rebuilds its civilisation in the ruins of ours, a model inhabitant of its ecosystem. In my paintings, these animals evolve in a possible future where the plant kingdom has undergone such alterations at the hands of man that mutant and disproportionate plants bear only a distant resemblance to those we know today.",
